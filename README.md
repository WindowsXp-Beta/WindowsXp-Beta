# Hello world :earth_asia:

![GitHub followers](https://img.shields.io/github/followers/WindowsXp-Beta?style=social)

This is Xinpeng Wei and you may find me as **WindowsXp** on the Internet.

I'm a Member of Technical Staff at [Amazon AGI SF Lab](https://labs.amazon.science/) working on reinforcement learning systems to empower building next-generation AI agents.

Before that, I received my master's and bechalor's degrees from [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) and [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), respectively.

As a computer systems enthusiast, my current focus centers on building scalable and robust systems for large-scale machine learning like large language models(LLMs). Specifically, I have experience/am getting my hands dirty in distributed training(e.g. 5D parallel), RLHF framework(e.g. veRL), high-performance/parallel programming(e.g. CUDA, MPI), inference frameworks(e.g. vLLM, Sglang), and other fancy technologies in this emerging field.

I used to work on traditional systems topics like operating systems, cloud infrastructure(Kubernetes), and database systems.

## More about me
